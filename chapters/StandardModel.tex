\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model (SM), the theoretical framework which describes fundamental particles
and their interactions, provides understanding for a wealth of results from accelerator-based
and cosmic ray-based experiments, in many cases with great accuracy. 

% The Higgs

Despite its unprecedented
level of success, the Standard Model presents an incomplete description of the universe and
the search continues for physics that falls outside of the realm of this theory.

% Remaining missing pieces of SM, examples

The current form of the SM is a quantum field theory that contains three symmetries

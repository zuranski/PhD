A search is performed for long-lived massive neutral particles decaying
 to quark-antiquark pairs. The experimental signature is a distinctive topology of a pair of jets originating at a
secondary vertex.
Events were collected by the CMS detector at the LHC during pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 8~TeV, and selected from data samples corresponding to 18.6 ~fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. No significant excess
is observed above standard model expectations, and an upper limit is set with 95\%~confidence level on the production
cross section of a heavy scalar resonance, decaying to two long-lived massive neutral particles, each decaying to
quark-antiquark pairs, as a function of the long-lived massive neutral particle
lifetime.

A search is performed for long-lived massive neutral particles decaying
 to quark-antiquark pairs. The experimental signature is a distinctive topology of a pair of
 hadronic jets originating at a
 secondary vertex.
 Events were collected by the CMS detector at the LHC during pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV, and selected from data samples corresponding to 18.5 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. No significant excess
 is observed above standard model expectations and an upper limit is set with 95$\%$ confidence level
 on the production cross section of a heavy scalar particle,
  $\text{H}^0$, in the mass range 200 to 1000 GeV, decaying into a pair of long-lived neutral $\text{X}^0$
   particles in the mass
   range 50 to 350 GeV, where each of the $\text{X}^0$ particles decay to quark-antiquark pairs. For $\text{X}^0$ mean proper lifetimes
   of 0.1 to 200 cm,
    the upper limits are typically 0.5$-$200 fb.
